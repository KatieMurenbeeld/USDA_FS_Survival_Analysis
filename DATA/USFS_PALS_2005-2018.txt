2. Relationship between files:        



3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package:

We did not include data covering projects initiated before 2005, as we could not verify the accuracy of this data, which was created prior to the creation of the PALS system.

   If yes, list versions:
           Name of file that was updated:
                     i. Why was the file updated?

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------


1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
<Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection>

In 2005 the US Forest Service began using a system called "Planning, Appeals, and Litigation System (PALS)" for recording all major events related to project planning throughout the agency, particularly as they relate to work required for environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act.
In April 2019 we accessed this data, with permission from the US Forest Service, and downloaded the Multi-Year Trend Report, which recorded meta-data about all USFS projects. The MYTR was a .csv file that did not contain the complete project records (which are present in the USFS version of this dataset).
We eliminated all projects initiated prior to 2005, because we were unable to verify that this information was entered accurately into the dataset.
Data are entered into the PALS system by officials throughout the National Forest System. 

2. Methods for processing the data: <describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data>

We error checked the data in STATA - further details on this process will be available in our forthcoming publiation

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:


4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:


5. Environmental/experimental conditions:


6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:


7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission:
All coauthors and no one else.
